# Portfolio

A small portfolio project to hold my projects, skills and information for the time being. It will be frequently updates to refelct my current skill level.

## Small Notes:
- This could have been an spa with no need for ssr, in fact a static html page would have been more than enough but I decided to use Svelte Kit for possible future usage of ssr info from an api and ease of updating the ui for interactivity
- Built using Scss, Svelte Kit, Vite

## Previewing
